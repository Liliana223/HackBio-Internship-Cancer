# Implement a simple NGS analysis on a simple dataset
NGS (next-generation sequencing) analysis of a simple dataset involves processing and analyzing DNA sequences to identify genetic variants. This type of analysis is essential in molecular biology studies, disease diagnosis, and the development of personalized treatments, as it allows for an understanding of genetic variability in biological samples. In this repository, the complete process of this analysis can be observed.
