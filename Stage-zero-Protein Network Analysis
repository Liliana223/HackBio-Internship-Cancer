 ## Protein-Protein Network Analysis
Cancer is a disease that arises from alterations in genetic material, induced by various factors such as the environment, heredity, or errors during cell multiplication. It is characterized by modifications in multiple signaling pathways and cellular processes, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, and DNA repair (1). Recent studies suggest that only three or fewer mutations are needed to trigger the onset of cancer (2,3).
Many human pathologies, including cancer, are the result of abnormal protein-protein interactions (PPI). PPI networks allow for the comprehensive mapping of these interactions, identifying key proteins, known as "hubs," that play a central role in tumor progression. These "hub" proteins are often the target of mutations that alter their interactions with other proteins, leading to cellular dysfunction that results in cancer. The analysis of PPI networks is fundamental in systems biology as it allows for the exploration and understanding of complex interactions between proteins within a cell. These networks not only provide information about functional relationships between proteins but also reveal how biological processes are coordinated at the molecular level. In a PPI network, each node represents a protein, while the connections (or edges) between nodes indicate a physical or functional interaction between the involved proteins (4).
A prominent example of the use of PPI network analysis in cancer research is the study of the p53 gene. Normally, p53 regulates apoptosis and DNA repair; however, in many types of cancer, p53 is mutated, which affects its ability to interact with other key proteins. This allows cancer cells to evade cell death and continue proliferating. The analysis of the p53 PPI network has revealed numerous interactions with proteins directly involved in the DNA damage response, facilitating the identification of new proteins that could be therapeutic targets to restore normal p53 function in cancer cells (5).
