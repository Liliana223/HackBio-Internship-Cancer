## Gram positive vs Negative bacteria
Cancer is a disease caused by alterations in genetic material, induced by various factors such as the environment, heredity, or errors in cell multiplication. It is characterized by changes in multiple signaling pathways and cellular processes, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, and DNA repair (1). Several studies have suggested that as few as three or fewer mutations may be sufficient to initiate cancer development (2,3).
Over the years, the method developed by Christian Gram in 1884 has enabled the classification of two main groups of bacteria: Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Gram-positive bacteria retain the violet stain, while Gram-negative bacteria do not. This differentiation is based on fundamental structural differences in the cell envelope of these two bacterial groups, which has significant implications for both their biology and their resistance to antibacterial treatments (4).
In recent years, there has been growing interest in the relationship between bacteria and cancer. Some Gram-negative bacteria, such as Helicobacter pylori, are implicated in the development of gastric cancer due to their ability to induce chronic inflammation and alter tissue integrity. H. pylori colonizes the stomach and can damage the gastric mucosa, which over time may contribute to carcinogenesis. The eradication of this bacterium through antibiotics has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of gastric cancer in high-risk populations. However, advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology have enabled the characterization of microbiome samples, including fecal and vaginal microbiomes, suggesting the presence of specific bacterial species within tumors. Surprisingly, some of these low-biomass bacteria associated with cancer have been found to reside within tumor and immune cells (5).
For example, the gut microbiome has been implicated as a critical environmental factor contributing to the tumorigenesis and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC) through pro-inflammatory responses, microbial metabolite production, and interference with cellular homeostasis in cancer cells. The study of tumor microbiomes with the aid of bioinformatics tools can be very useful for identifying microbial diversity, metabolite abundance, and deciphering their association with CRC (6).
